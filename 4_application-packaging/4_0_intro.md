# 4\. Application Packaging Compatibility

Devices implementations:

*    [C-0-1] MUST be capable of installing and running Android “.apk” files as
generated by the “aapt” tool included in the
[official Android SDK](
http://developer.android.com/tools/help/index.html).
   *   As the above requirement may be challenging, device implementations are
   RECOMMENDED to use the AOSP reference implementation's package management
   systemDevice implementations.
*    [C-0-2] MUST support verifying “.apk” files using the
[APK Signature Scheme v2](https://source.android.com/security/apksigning/v2.html)
and [JAR signing](
https://source.android.com/security/apksigning/v2.html#v1-verification).
*    [C-0-3] MUST NOT extend either the
[.apk](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/fundamentals.html),
[Android Manifest](
http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html),
[Dalvik bytecode](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/dalvik/), or
RenderScript bytecode formats in such a way that would prevent those files from
installing and running correctly on other compatible devices.
*    [C-0-4] MUST NOT allow apps other than the current
"installer of record" for the package to silently uninstall the app without any
prompt, as documented in the SDK for the [`DELETE_PACKAGE`](
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#DELETE_PACKAGES)
permission. The only exceptions are the system package verifier app handling
[PACKAGE_NEEDS_VERIFICATION](
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_PACKAGE_NEEDS_VERIFICATION)
intent and the storage manager app handling [ACTION_MANAGE_STORAGE](
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/storage/StorageManager.html#ACTION_MANAGE_STORAGE)
intent.
